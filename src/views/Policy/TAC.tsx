            All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be
            exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent
            that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be
            limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this
            Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or
            portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
            illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
            jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining
            provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with
            respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining
            provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and

            any disputes arising out of it shall be governed by the substantive
            and procedural laws of Germany without regard to its rules on
            conflicts or choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws
            of Germany. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related
            to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts located in Germany,
            and you hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
            You hereby waive any right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising
            out of or related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention
